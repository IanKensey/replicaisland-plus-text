This project is a simple extension of the "Replica Island" codebase available from:<br>
<a href='http://code.google.com/p/replicaisland/'>http://code.google.com/p/replicaisland/</a>


It adds support for texture based text. We may fold it into Replica Island in the future. Look for code that is affected by DebugText.TEXT_DEMO to see an example of adding a text element to the screen. <br>

The main additions are these files:<br>
<ul><li>FontInfo<br>
</li><li>FontLibrary<br>
</li><li>DrawableText<br>
</li><li>DebugText<br>
</li><li>generic_font.png<br>
</li><li>generic_font.fnt</li></ul>


The PNG / FNT files for the supplied "generic font" were created with the Bitmap Font Generator from:<br>
<a href='http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/'>http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/</a>


The text classes were created for the game <a href='http://turtlerockgarage.com/leapsheep/android.htm'>Leap Sheep!</a>, and their scope has been limited to the requirements of that game. Feature requests and bug reports are welcome.<br>
